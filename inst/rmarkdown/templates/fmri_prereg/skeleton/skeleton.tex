all prompts and tables, can fill in the table or write paragraph below
as you would for paper and use table as checklist of topics
covered.Planned comparison If the experiment has multiple conditions,
what are the specific planned comparisons, or is an omnibus ANOVA
used?General issuesFor novel methods that are not described in detail in
a separate paper, provide explicit descriptionand validation of
method.Remember to include package and package version used for each
test.First level (fx) modelingEventrelated design predictors.- Modeled

typically one of:Canonical only.Canonical plus temporal
derivative.Canonical plus temporal and dispersion derivative. Smooth

Impulse Response model.Drift regressors (e.g.~DCT basis in SPM, with
specified cutoff). fMRI preregistration template \textbar{} Jessica
FlanneryMovement regressors; specify if squares and/or temporal
derivative used.Any other nuisance regressors, and whether they were
entered as interactions (e.g.~with a task effect in 1st level fMRI, or
with group effect).Any orthogonalization of regressors, and set of other
regressors used to orthogonalize against.Contrast construction (Exactly
what terms are subtracted from what? Define these in terms of task or
stimulus conditions (e.g., using abstract names such as AUDSTIM,
VISSTIM) instead ofunderlying psychological concepts.Autocorrelation
model type (e.g., AR(1), AR(1) + WN, or arbitrary autocorrelation
function), and whether global or local.(e.g., for SPM2/SPM5,
`Approximate AR(1) autocorrelation model estimated at omnibus
F-significant voxels (P \textless{} 0.001), used globally over the whole
brain'; for FSL, `Autocorrelation function estimated locally at each
voxel, tapered and regularized in space.').Second level (group)
modelingStatistical model and estimation method, inference type
(mixed/random effects or fixed), e.g., ``Mixed effects inference with
one sample t-test on summary statistic'' (SPM2/SPM5), e.g., ``Mixed
effects inference with Bayesian 2-level model with fast approximation to
posterior probability of activation.'' (FSL)If fixed effects inference
used, justifyIf more than 2-levels, describe the levels and assumptions
of the model (e.g., are variances assumed equal between groups)Repeated
measures? If multiple measurements per subject, list method to account
for within subject correlation, exact assumptions made about
correlation/variancee.g., SPM: ``Within-subject correlation estimated at
F-significant voxels (P \textless{}0.001), then used globally over whole
brain''; or, if variances for each measure are allowed to vary,
``Within-subject correlation and relative variance
estimated\ldots{}''For group model with repeated measures, specify:- How
condition effects are modeled (e.g.~as factors, or as linear trends).-
Whether subject effects are modeled (i.e.~as regressors, as opposed
towith a covariance structure).For group effects: clearly state whether
or not covariates are split by group (i.e.~fit as a groupby-covariate
interaction).Model type (Some suggested terms include:- ``Mass
Univariate''.- ``Multivariate'' (e.g.~ICA on whole brain data).- ``Mass
Multivariate'' (e.g.~MANOVA on diffusion or morphometry tensordata).-
``Local Multivariate'' (e.g.~``searchlight'').- ``Multivariate,
intrasubject predictive'' (e.g.~classify individual trials
ineventrelated fMRI).- ``Multivariate intersubject predictive''
(e.g.~classify subjects as patient vs.control).- ``Representational
Similarity Analysis''.)Model settings (The essential details of the
model. For massunivariate, first level fMRI, these include:- Drift
model, if not already specified as a dependent variable (e.g.~locally
linear fMRI preregistration template \textbar{} Jessica
Flannerydetrending of data \& regressors, as in FSL).- Autocorrelation
model (e.g.~global approximate AR(1) in SPM; locally regularized
autocorrelation function in FSL).For massunivariate second level fMRI
these include:- Fixed effects (all subjects' data in one model).- Random
or mixedeffects model, implemented with:- Ordinary least squares (OLS,
aka unweighted summary statistics approach; SPM default, FSL FEAT's
``Simple OLS'').- weighted least squares (i.e.~FSL FEAT's ``FLAME 1''),
using voxelwise estimate of between subject variance.- Global weighted
least squares (i.e.~SPM's MFX).With any group (multisubject) model,
indicate any specific variance structure, e.g.- Unequal variance between
groups (and if globally pooled, as in SPM).- If repeated measures, the
specific covariance structure assumed (e.g.compound symmetric, or
arbitrary; if globally pooled).For localmultivariate report:- The number
of voxels in the local model.- Local model used (e.g.~Canonical
Correlation Analysis) with anyconstraints (e.g.~positive weights
only).ROI analysisHow were ROIs defined (e.g., functional, anatomical,
parcel localizer)?How was signal extracted within ROI?(e.g., average
parameter estimates, FIR deconvolution?)If percent signal change
reported, how was scaling factor determined (e.g., height of block
regressor or height of isolated event regressor)?Is change relative to
voxel-mean, or whole-brain mean?Justify definition of ROI and analysis
conducted with it: (e.g., if your ROI is defined based on the cluster;
how will you ensure your ROI analyses are not circular?)If not
previously specified above, what statistical model will you use to test
each hypothesis? Please include the type of model (e.g.~ANOVA, multiple
regression, SEM, etc) and the specification of the model (this includes
each variable that will be included as predictors, outcomes, or
covariates). Please specify any interactions that will be tested and
remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory
test in your final article.Recommendations of fMRI details come from
