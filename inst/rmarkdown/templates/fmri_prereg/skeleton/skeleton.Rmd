<!-- The goal of this template is to provide sufficient information in preregistration for fMRI data design to increase reproducible reporting practices. Text was adopted from the OSF preregistration challenge template to include the details important for fMRI psychology design. OSF template is retained in some areas and edited in other areas to incorporate both prior published templates and guidelines (Nichols et al., 2016; Poldrack et al., 2008; van’t Veer & Giner-Sorolla, 2016). https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/20/054262https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2287206/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116301925 -->

<!-- Quick notes:All prompts and tables can be used to fill in as it, or as a checklist of information you include for text for that section or checklist for attached files (e.g., json file of scan parameters). Tip: Using it as a checklist will allow you to write these sections as they will appear in your future paper. If a certain table/section does not apply, can just state “N/A.” This is also a base template and will not be sufficient for every type of fMRI analysis. If your methods require additional checklists, please include! -->

## Project Title

Enter your response here.



## Introduction
<!-- This can be as complete as you like, but at least a brief introduction is suggested to help to ensure literature review is done prior to hypotheses and help ensure your hypotheses are properly informed basedon the literature. -->

Enter your response here.



## Aims & Hypotheses
<!-- Description of essential elements
    1.Describe the (numbered) hypotheses in terms of directional relationships between your (manipulated or measured) variables.
    2.For interaction effects, describe the expected shape of the interactions.
    3.If you are manipulating a variable, make predictions for successful check variables or explain why no manipulation check is included. -->

<!-- Recommended elements
    4.A figure or table may be helpful to describe complex interactions; this facilitates correct specification of the ordering of all group means. 
    5.For original research, add rationales or theoretical frameworks for why a certain hypothesis is tested.
    6.If multiple predictions can be made for the same IV-DV combination, describe what outcome would be predicted by which theory.

## Existing Data
<!-- Preregistration is designed to make clear the distinction between confirmatory tests, specified prior to seeing the data, and exploratory analyses conducted after observing the data. Therefore, creating a research plan in which existing data will be used presents unique challenges. Please select the description that best describes your situation. --> 

**Registration prior to creation of data**

**Registration prior to any human observation of the data**

**Registration prior to accessing the data**

**Registration prior to analysis of the data**

**Registration following analysis of the data**



## Explanation of Existing Data
<!-- If you indicate that you will be using some data that already exist in this study, please describe the steps you have taken to assure that you are unaware of any patterns or summary statistics in the data. This may include an explanation of how access to the data has been limited, who has observed the data, or how you have avoided observing any analysis of the specific data you will use in your study. The purpose of this question is to assure that the line between confirmatory and exploratory analysis is clear. E.g., links to prior papers, osf project page, prior posters or talks, or descriptions. -->

## Statistical inference
<!--For all prompts and tables, can fill in the table or write paragraph below as you would for paper and use table as checklist of topics covered. -->

### Inference on statistic image (thresholding)

- Search region:
<!-- 
- Type of search region for analysis, and the volume in voxels or CC
- If not whole brain, state how region was determined; method for constructing region should be independent of present statistic image
- Whole brain or “small volume”: Carefully describe any small volume correction used for each contrast.
    - If a small-volume correction mask is defined anatomically, provide named anatomical regions from a publicly available ROI atlas.
    - If small-volume correction mask is functionally defined, clearly describe the functional taskand identify any risk of circularity.
    - All small-volume corrections should be fully described in the methods section, not just mentioned in passing in the results. -->
Enter your response here.
    
    
- Statistical type:
<!-- Typically one of:
    - Voxelwise (aka peakwise in SPM)
    - Cluster-wise
        - Cluster size
        - Cluster mass
        - Thresholdfree Cluster Enhancement (TFCE)
- For cluster size or mass, report: Cluster-forming threshold
- For all clusterwise methods, report: Neighborhood size used to form clusters (e.g. 6, 18 or 26)
- For TFCE, report: Use of nondefault TFCE parameters.) -->
Enter your response here.


- P value computation:
<!-- Report if anything but standard parametric inference used to obtain (uncorrected) Pvalues. If nonparametric method was used, report method (e.g. permutation or bootstrap) and number of permutations/samples used -->
Enter your response here.


- Multiple test correction:
<!-- For massunivariate, specify the type of correction and how it is obtained, especially if not the typical usage.
- Usually one of:
    - Familywise Error
        - Random Field Theory (typical)
        - Permutation
        - Monte Carlo
        - Bonferroni
    - False Discovery Rate
        - Benjamini & Hochberg FDR (typical)
        - Positive FDR
        - Local FDR
        - Clusterlevel FDR
    - None/Uncorrected

- If permutation or Monte Carlo, report the number of permutations/samples. If Monte Carlo, note the brain mask and smoothness used, and how smoothness was estimated.
- If correction is limited to a small volume, the method for selecting the region should be stated explicitly.
- If no formal multiple comparisons method is used, the inference must be explicitly labeled “uncorrected.”
- If FWE found by random field theory list the smoothness in mm FWHM and the RESEL count
- If FWE found by simulation (e.g., AFNI AlphaSim), provide details of parameters for simulation
- If not a standard method, specify the method for finding significance (e.g., “Custom in-lab software was used to construct statistic maps and thresholded at FDR< 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)”
- If cluster-wise significance, state cluster-defining threshold (e.g., P = 0.001) -->
Enter your response here.


- False negative discussion:
<!-- Any discussion of failure to reject the null hypothesis (e.g., lack of activation in a particular region) should be accompanied by SNR or effect size of the actually observed effect (allows reader to infer power to estimate an effect) -->
Enter your response here.


### Functional connectivity

- Confound adjustment & filtering  Report:
<!-- 
- Method for detecting movement artifacts, movement-related variation, and remediation (e.g. ‘scrubbing’, ‘despiking’, etc).
- Use of global signal regression, exact type of global signal used and how it was computed.
- Whether a high or lowpass temporal filtering is applied to data, and at which point in the analysis pipeline. Note, any temporal regression model using filtered data should have its regressors likewise filtered. -->
Enter your response here.


- Multivariate method:
<!-- Independent Component Analysis
- Report:
    - Algorithm to estimate components.
    - Number of components (if fixed), or algorithm for estimating number of components.
    - If used, method to synthesize multiple runs.
    - Sorting method of IC’s, if any.
    - Detailed description of how components were chosen for further analysis. -->
Enter your response here.


- Dependent variable definition:
<!-- For seed-based analyses report:
    - Definition of the seed region(s).
    - Rationale for choosing these regions.
- For region-based analyses report:
    - Number of ROIs.
    - How the ROI’s are defined (e.g. citable anatomical atlas; auxiliary fMRI experiments); note if ROIs overlap.
    - Assignment of signals to regions (i.e. how a time series is obtained from each region, e.g. averaging or first singular vector)
    - Note if considering only bilateral (L+R) merged regions.
    - Note if considering only interhemispheric homotopic connectivity. -->
Enter your response here.


- Functional connectivity measure/ model:
<!-- Report:
    - Measure of dependence used, e.g. Pearson’s (full) correlation, partial correlation, mutual information, etc; also specify:
        - Use of Fisher’s Z-transform (Yes/No) and, if standardised, effective N is used to compute standard error (to account for any filtering operations on the data).
        - Estimator used for partial correlation.
        - Estimator used for mutual information.
    - Regression model used to remove confounding effects (Pearson or partial correlation). -->
Enter your response here.


- Effectivity connectivity:
<!--  Report:
    - Model
    - Algorithm used to fit model

    - Itemize models considered, and method used for model comparison. -->
Enter your response here.


- Graph analysis:
<!-- Report the ‘dependent variable’ and ‘functional connectivity measure’ used (see above).
- Specify either:
    - Weighted graph analysis or,
    - Binarized graph analysis is used, clarifying the method used for thresholding (e.g. a 10% density threshold, or a statistically defined threshold); consider the sensitivity of your findings to the particular choice of threshold used.
- Itemise the graph summaries used (e.g. clustering coefficient, efficiency, etc), whether these are global or pernode/peredge summaries. In particular with fMRI or EEG, clarify if measures applied to individual subject networks or group networks. -->

<!--Recommendations of fMRI details come from Nichols et al., 2016; Poldrack et al., 2008.For extended checklist guidelines for this section following data analysis, see PHBM COBIDAS report Nichols et al., 2016. -->



## Follow-up Analyses:
<!-- If not specified previously, will you be conducting any confirmatory analyses to follow up on effects in your statistical model, such as subgroup analyses, pairwise or complex contrasts, or follow-up tests from interactions? Remember that any analyses not specified in this research plan must be noted as exploratory. -->

Enter your response here.


## Exploratory Analyses:
<!-- If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time. -->
