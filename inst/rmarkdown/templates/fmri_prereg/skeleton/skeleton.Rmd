<!-- The goal of this template is to provide sufficient information in preregistration for fMRI data design to increase reproducible reporting practices. Text was adopted from the OSF preregistration challenge template to include the details important for fMRI psychology design. OSF template is retained in some areas and edited in other areas to incorporate both prior published templates and guidelines (Nichols et al., 2016; Poldrack et al., 2008; van’t Veer & Giner-Sorolla, 2016). https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/05/20/054262https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2287206/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103116301925 -->

<!-- Quick notes:All prompts and tables can be used to fill in as it, or as a checklist of information you include for text for that section or checklist for attached files (e.g., json file of scan parameters). Tip: Using it as a checklist will allow you to write these sections as they will appear in your future paper. If a certain table/section does not apply, can just state “N/A.” This is also a base template and will not be sufficient for every type of fMRI analysis. If your methods require additional checklists, please include! -->

## Project Title

Enter your response here.


## Introduction
<!-- This can be as complete as you like, but at least a brief introduction is suggested to help to ensure literature review is done prior to hypotheses and help ensure your hypotheses are properly informed basedon the literature. -->

Enter your response here.


## Aims & Hypotheses
<!-- Description of essential elements
    1.Describe the (numbered) hypotheses in terms of directional relationships between your (manipulated or measured) variables.
    2.For interaction effects, describe the expected shape of the interactions.
    3.If you are manipulating a variable, make predictions for successful check variables or explain why no manipulation check is included. -->

<!-- Recommended elements
    4.A figure or table may be helpful to describe complex interactions; this facilitates correct specification of the ordering of all group means. 
    5.For original research, add rationales or theoretical frameworks for why a certain hypothesis is tested.
    6.If multiple predictions can be made for the same IV-DV combination, describe what outcome would be predicted by which theory.

## Existing Data
<!-- Preregistration is designed to make clear the distinction between confirmatory tests, specified prior to seeing the data, and exploratory analyses conducted after observing the data. Therefore, creating a research plan in which existing data will be used presents unique challenges. Please select the description that best describes your situation. --> 

**Registration prior to creation of data**

**Registration prior to any human observation of the data**

**Registration prior to accessing the data**

**Registration prior to analysis of the data**

**Registration following analysis of the data**


## Explanation of Existing Data
<!-- If you indicate that you will be using some data that already exist in this study, please describe the steps you have taken to assure that you are unaware of any patterns or summary statistics in the data. This may include an explanation of how access to the data has been limited, who has observed the data, or how you have avoided observing any analysis of the specific data you will use in your study. The purpose of this question is to assure that the line between confirmatory and exploratory analysis is clear. E.g., links to prior papers, osf project page, prior posters or talks, or descriptions. -->

Enter your response here.


## Details of Larger Study
<!-- If yes, provide a brief description of the larger study. Note, this does not need to include a list of all measures included in the larger study, but it is meant to provide context for the larger scope of the project.
If applicable, A) Link to OSF project page, B) Link to collaborator’s related preregistrations, posters, etc.
Explanation of how information from larger study or related studies within the larger project have/have not influenced your hypotheses/ measurement decisions. -->

Is your preregistration part of a larger project?

**Yes**

**No**

<!-- Please describe the process by which you will collect your data. For all tables, you can fill in the table or write paragraph below as you would for paper and use table as checklist of topics covered.
Recommendations of fMRI details come from Nichols et al., 2016; Poldrack et al., 2008. For extended checklist guidelines for this section following data analysis, see PHBM COBIDAS report Nichols et al., 2016. -->
